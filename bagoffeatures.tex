\chapter{Bag of Words for scene localization}

\textbf{Brief overview of the chapter.
I will mention the Visual BoW is used due to its robustness 
compared to naive matching for computing the images similarity 
based on similarity}

\section{Scene Localization in indoor} 
Will briefly discuss about indoor scene localisation 
alos stating that GPS is not reliable in indoors. 


\subsection{Localization Methodology}
I will first discuss why naive matching is not used 
for scene matching i.e. not efficient for 
real time etc. 

I will discuss the image based 
topological representation used by us 
with some detail.

\subsection{Related Work}
I will discuss the different works in which 
researchers have used visual BoW 
for scene matching or localisation.

\section{Proposed Visual BoW System}
I will state the overall algorithm of 
my visual BoW system. 
Then I will discuss the 
key phases in detail.
