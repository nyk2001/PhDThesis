\chapter{Verification methods for Visual Bag of Words}
A bbrief overview of the chapter.

\section{Related Work}
I will first mention what are the verification methods 
and their importance in visual BoW.
I will then discuss the verification methods used
by different researchers in visual BoW 
or separately.


\section{Verification Methods}
Here I will state the verification methods used by 
for my visual BoW.

\subsection{sift distance Based (sd-BoW)}
I will briefly discuss the technique followed 
by the algorithm and image matching examples.
I will also mention the references from where 
this method is inspired from.

\subsection{sift hue based (sha-BoW)}
I will briefly discuss the technique followed 
by the algorithm and image matching examples.
I will also mention the references from where 
this method is inspired from.


\subsection{selective hue based (sh-BoW)}
I will briefly discuss the technique followed 
by the algorithm and image matching examples.
I will also mention the references from where 
this method is inspired from.


\subsection{local binary pattern based (LBP-BoW)}
I will briefly discuss the technique followed 
by the algorithm and image matching examples.
I will also mention the references from where 
this method is inspired from.

\subsection{homography based (p-BoW)}
I will discuss our proposed method in detail. 

\subsection{fundamental matrix based (fm-BoW)}
I will briefly discuss the technique followed 
by the algorithm and image matching examples.
I will also mention the references from where 
this method is inspired from.
